# COAST
### Constrained Optimization and Sensitivity for Thermochronology

This package is for thermochronological modeling and has two main focuses: 

- **sensitivity analysis**: quantifying how uncertainties in input parameters explain the variance of permissible Temperature-time paths and vice-versa using both global and local sensitivity analysis techniques
- **open-source forward and inverse thermochronlogical modeling**: a community-oriented resource for thermal history inversion

#### **COAST** can be accessed in three ways:
---
1. Using the GUI at <coast.thermochron.org>
2. Downloading this repository as a julia package. Julia can be downloaded [here](https://julialang.org/downloads/ "available for Mac, Linux, Windows").
Clone this repository by pasting
```shell
git clone https://github.com/ryanstoner1/COAST.jl.git
```
in the terminal/shell/command prompt.

```julia
    (v1.1) pkg> add https://github.com/ryanstoner1/COAST.jl
```
3. Use docker (Under construction)
